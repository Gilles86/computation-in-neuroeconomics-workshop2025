    "# DDM Performance Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Compare the performance of different DDM implementations and explore how hardware backends affect simulation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementations Available\n",
    "You have three implementations to compare:\n",
    "- Pure Python: Simple but slow (uses interpreted loops)\n",
    "- NumPy: Vectorized operations (faster)\n",
    "- TensorFlow: GPU-accelerated (potentially fastest)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Basic Performance Comparison\n",
    "1. Run each implementation with the same parameters (e.g., `n_trials=10000`)\n",
    "2. Measure and compare execution times\n",
    "3. Verify that all implementations produce similar results by comparing the RT and response distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Hardware Backend Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, (i.e., on a Macbook M1/M2/M3), try out how much the GPU helps compared to CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# CPU execution\n",
    "with tf.device('/CPU:0'):\n",
    "    # Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "# GPU execution (if available)\n",
    "gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n",
    "if gpus:\n",
    "    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)  # Prevents memory issues\n",
    "    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):\n",
    "        # Your code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Tips:**\n",
    "- Metal (M1/M2) works automatically - no config needed\n",
    "- Always clear session between tests: `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()`\n",
    "- First run includes compilation time - discard it\n",
    "- Take minimum of 3+ runs for accurate timing\n",
    "### Part 3: Performance Analysis\n",
    "1. Test with different numbers of trials: [100, 1000, 10000, 100000]\n",
    "2. Create performance plots showing:\n",
    "   - Execution time vs. number of trials\n",
    "   - Speedup factors between implementations\n",
    "3. Answer these questions:\n",
    "   - Which implementation is fastest for small vs. large trial counts?\n",
    "   - How does performance scale with the number of trials?\n",
    "   - What are the tradeoffs between the different implementations?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Advanced Exploration (Bonus)\n",
    "1. Test different time steps (`dt` values) and their effect on:\n",
    "   - Performance\n",
    "   - Result accuracy\n",
    "2. Compare single (float32) vs. double (float64) precision\n",
    "3. Investigate memory usage differences between implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5: GPUs on Sciencecluster\n",
    "If you have an account on sciencecluster, and you feel like it, you\n",
    "can try to run the different implementation on the high-end GPUs\n",
    "(T4/A100/V100/H100)\n",
    "available there.\n",
